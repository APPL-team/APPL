# Question Answering
In this example, we make the LLM answer questions based on a given quotation. The LLM is expected to extract the name of the author from the quotation and answer the questions based on the author's information. The example is inspired by the OpenAI cookbook article: [How to work with large language models](https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/how_to_work_with_large_language_models).
