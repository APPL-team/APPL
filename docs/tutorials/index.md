# Welcome to APPL Tutorial

Welcome to APPL: **A** **P**rompt **P**rogramming **L**anguage. This tutorial will guide you through the basics of APPL, help you understand the core concepts, and [get you started](./1_get_started.md) with writing your first APPL program.

## What is APPL?

APPL is designed to enhance Python with prompt programming capabilities, making it easier to interact with language models (LMs). It provides a set of tools and abstractions to streamline prompt creation, LM interaction, concurrent execution, and more.

## Audience
APPL is based on Python, so it is suitable for Python developers who want to leverage language models in their applications. It is also useful for data scientists, researchers, and anyone interested in exploring the capabilities of language models.

Please get yourself familiar with Python before diving into APPL. If you are new to Python, you can start with the [official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html).
